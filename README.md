![alt text](https://github.com/lohengliang/lohengliang.github.io/blob/master/static/img/thestraitstimesclone.png?raw=true)

This is a clone of The Straits Times' page using React.

The webpage consists of six React components, representing things like header and footer. Quite a number of css adjustments are needed to make the page close to the real version.
